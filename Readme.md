##Pc-Hunter Project
- This project is a layout of an online store that allows the user to purchase both individual components for the computer, and a fully assembled system unit. Also an important part of the functionality of this site is the ability of the user, "with their own hands", to assemble a suitable one for their individual requests (it will be possible in the future).<br/>
- The site has the ability to add products to the page according to the category, through the admin panel. You can also register on the site, or log in to an existing account. Important: an unregistered user will not be able to purchase the product. The site also has a cart working system for each user.
